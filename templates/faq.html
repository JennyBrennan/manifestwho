    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2>How did you choose the quotations?</h2>

    <h2>Why are some parties included/not included?</h2>
    <p>The parties included are cross-UK parties, which currently have sitting MPs or MEPs.</p> 
    <p>Regional parties (e.g. SNP, Plaid Cymru, Sinn FÃ©inn, DUP) aren't included because their regional policy focus is a bit of a give away for the quiz. The most well-known cross-UK parties currently without sitting MPs or MEPs are probably UKIP, the Women's Equality Party and the Monster Raving Loony Party.</p> 
    <p>We needed some criteria to make sure the list wasn't too long, but am very open to feedback on whether these were the right ones.</p>

    <h2>Do you store anything about me?</h2>
    <p>No. We don't store personal data.</p>
    <p>We do store the quiz anwers given to us with an anonymous id, and if you choose to let us know your party affiliation, we'll store that with the same anonymous id. But we have no way of tracing that back to you and we'd never want to. </p>
    <p>We're storing the results to see if we can learn something about how well understood parties' manifestos and beliefs are. If we do learn anything, we'll make it freely available.</p>

    <h2>Is this site party affiliated/backed/some kind of conspiracy?</h2>
    <p>Nope. It's made by one politics nerd with no secret plan.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>How is the quiz made?</h2>
    <p>It's a web app using Python, Flask and PostgreSQL. The code is open sourced <a href="https://github.com/JennyBrennan/manifestwho">on GitHub</a>.</p>
